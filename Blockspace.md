##Intro

This piece assumes that total fees on bitcoin need to rise substantially in order to compensate for the declining block subsidy.

Barring any subsantial changes to bitcoin's protocol, this assumption suggests that a robust "blockspace market" must emerge in the coming decades to compensate for the declining subsidy.

Some researchers have pointed to flat or declining total fees on bitcoin from the past few years as evidence that bitcoin is not making progress in this regard.

Here I make the case that "total fees on bitcoin over time" is not a meaningful metric at this point in time, and that paying attention to average blocksize over time is more indicative (for now).

##Two Phases of Blockspace Market Development

The development of a sufficient blockspace market can be thought of in two phases.

The first phrase is the period before blocks are consisistently full (abundant blockspace phase), and the second phrase is after blocks are consistently full (scarce blockspace phase).

During the abundant blockspace phase, the metric of "% of unused blockspace" is much more indicative of progress we are making. As long as it trends toward zero,  

During the *second* phase, the metric "total fees on bitcoin over time" will be much more informative.




(1) Until blocks are consistently full, fees will remain ~0. Once blocks are regularly full, fees shoot up, hockey-stick graph style.
(2) We're still working through lots of low-hanging fruit when it comes to blockspace efficiency, both in terms of:
(2a) fitting the same economic activity into less blockspace
(2b) smoothening out blockspace demand peaks and troughs

In detail:

(1) If blocks aren't full, you can pay 1 sat/vbyte, and get confirmed quickly, so why pay more? For many many transactions, you can even wait a few days or a week, so as long as mempools empty out by Sunday afternoons, a LOT of blockspace can be purchased dirt cheap.

Once you have periods where blocks are full and it is unclear if/when they will empty out again, 1 sat/vbyte transactions are gone. You have to bid against the other participants, no matter how patient you are.

This is a sort of inflection point at which the blockspace market gets "turned on", so to speak.

In the short terms (days/weeks), it sometimes happens that a queue of unconfirmed transations builds up, which means you have to bid higher fees if you want confirmation at all.
