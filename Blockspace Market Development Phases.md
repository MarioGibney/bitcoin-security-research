[work in progress]

## Background

It remains an open question whether bitcoin fees will rise substantially in the coming decades to compensate for the declining block subsidy.

Some researchers have pointed to flat or declining total fees per block from the past several years as evidence that bitcoin is not making progress in this regard.

Here I make the case that _fees per block_ is not a meaningful metric at this point in time for guaging the development of a robust blockspace market. Rather, _unused blockspace_ is a more indicative metric at present.


## Two Phases of Blockspace Market Development

The development of a robust blockspace market can be divided into two phases.

The first phase is the period when blocks are **not** consistently full (Blockspace Abundance), and the second phrase is when blocks **are** consistently full (Blockspace Scarcity).

During Blockspace Abundance (the phase we are in now), unused blockspace is a much more indicative metric of progress than fees per block - the more it moves toward zero, the closer we get to reaching Blockspace Scarcity. This is because while unused blockspace remains greater than zero, it cannot be expected for fees to rise meaningfully at all, since blockspace can be easily claimed for 1 sat/vbyte.

During Blockspace Scarcity, the situation changes dramatically. One cannot simply broadcast a transaction at the minimum fee and patiently wait for confirmation. Instead, all potential users of blockspace must compete by bidding, regardless of how patient they are. In a certain sense, the blockspace market only really begins to develop once this happens. In this phase, fees per block as a simple metric become much more indicative.

This distinction helps avoid the trap where blocks go from 70% full to 80% full, to 90% full (constituting real progress), but because fees don't rise meaningfully during that time, people mistakenly believe that blockspace market development is stagnant.

## Notes
### A Fuzzy Line

The distinction between periods of Blockspace Abundance and Scarcity may not be very clean. There have been (and may be more) periods that switched between the two phases if you look at data by the month. But considering that the longest periods of Blockspace Scarcity have been no more than a few months, when viewing the subject from a long (multi-decade) timeframe, it is safe to say that we are still under Blockspace Abundance.

Assuming a robust blockspace market does eventually form, it remains plausible that there will be a long intermediate phase of switching back and forth between Blockspace Abundance and Scarcity with gradually lengthening periods of full blocks before Blockspace Scarcity becomes the permanent norm. Also plausible is that some phenomenon triggers a swift uptick in blockspace demand at the right time and that the transition occurs very quickly and cleanly.

In any case, the more one zooms out and look at longer term trends, the less obfuscating a potentially fuzzy transitionary period will be.


### Other Factors

Despite its usefuleness as an indicator, unused blockspace can still be confounded or distorted by other factors (especially as the transition to Blockspace Scarcity approaches). I will expand on this in a future piece.
